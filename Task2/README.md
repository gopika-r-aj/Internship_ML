# Task 2 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

The goal of this task was to understand the Titanic dataset using basic statistics and visualizations. This helps us find patterns, trends, and any unusual data before building machine learning models.

# What I Did
- Checked data types, missing values, and summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
- Plotted histograms and boxplots to explore the distribution of features like Age and Fare.
- Used a correlation matrix and pairplot to study relationships between features.
- Found useful insights like:
    * Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
    * Passengers in 1st class had better survival odds.
    * Fare is positively skewed with some high-value outliers.
    * Age distribution is fairly normal but has missing values.
    * Strong correlation between Fare and Pclass.
    * No strong multicollinearity found among numeric features.

# Outputs
All plots and printed outputs are available in the `Output_Screenshots` folder, including:
- Boxplots
- Histograms of numeric features
- Correlation matrix heatmap
- Pairplot with survival outcome
- Summary statistics and grouped survival rates
